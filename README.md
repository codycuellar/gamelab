# Getting Started
This is just a playground for experimenting in making games. Right now there's a basic snake game, and a monster truck game. To set up either one, from the repo root, run:
```bash
python -m venve venv

# run either of the follow commands depending on platform
# on mac terminal run:
source venv/bin/activate
# on Windows gitbash run
source venv/Scripts/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From there you can go into one of the game pacakges and run the game or work on it.
